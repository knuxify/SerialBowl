Access any serial console

## Call for contributors

**NOTE**: This has not been thoroughly tested! My only use case for a serial console is using it read-only (*sometimes* write-only) through a UART dongle. I make no guarantee that it will work on any other hardware!

If you own any other serial devices, and would like to contribute, feel free to do so! Even opening an issue with your own suggestions is already very helpful.

# Serial Bowl

Access any serial console

## About

This is a small pet project of mine to replace my current serial console app of choice, [CuteCom]. It's *alright*, it's small and does its job - and does so without a fuss. However, it's not exactly right for my job - the terminal it displays is notably missing support for colored text and doesn't use a monospaced font.

So, I figured, "why not make my own"?

I don't intend to develop this nearly as much as Ear Tag. This is a simple app, and it will do what I need it to do, and nothing else.
